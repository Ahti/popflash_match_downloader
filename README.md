> This tool is a wip and does not have configuration files etc yet.

This gem contains a utility to download demos of your recent matches from [popflash.site](https://popflash.site).

It works by scraping your user page, which contains a list of your five most recent matches. It then finds the match download link on each matches page and downloads the demo, if it hasn't already been downloaded.

## Installation

```bash
$ gem install popflash_match_downloader
```
